    "This notebook is all about **getting you started doing Reproducible Data Science** , and giving you a **deeper look** at some of the concepts we will cover in this tutorial. For the latest version of this notebook, visit: \n",

    "\n",
    "## The Bare Minimum\n",
    "You will need:\n",
    "* `conda` (via anaconda or miniconda)\n",
    "* `cookiecutter` \n",
    "* `make`\n",
    "* `git`\n",
    "* `python >= 3.6` (via `conda`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Anaconda\n",
    "We use `conda` for handling package dependencies, maintaining virtual environments, and installing particular version of python. For proper integration with pip, you should make sure you are running conda >= 4.4.0. Some earlier versions of conda have difficulty with editable packages (which is how we install our `src` package)\n",

    "`cookiecutter` is a python tool for creating projects from project templates. We use cookiecutter to create a reproducible data science template for starting our data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install it:\n",
    "\n",
    "  conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter\n",

    "We use gnu `make` (and `Makefiles`) as a convenient interface to the various stages of the reproducible data science data flow. If for some reason your system doesn't have make installed, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "  conda install -c anaconda make\n",

    "We use git (in conjunction with a workflow tool like GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab) to manage version control. \n",
    "\n",

    "A typical data science process involves three main kinds of tasks:\n",
    "* Munge: Fetch, process data, do EDA\n",
    "* Science: Train models, Predict, Transform data\n",
    "* Deliver: Analyze, summarize, publish\n",

    "\n",
    "We're going to try to improve this to a process that is **reproducible from start to finish**. \n",

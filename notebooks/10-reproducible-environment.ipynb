    "It's impossible to have Reproducible Data Science, without **reproducible code**. If your code, run by someone else (or on a different machine) produces different results, then it is not reproducible. To fix this, we need to have a reproducible environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we need **virtual environments**. In this case, we're going to use `conda` as this is the most common choice within this community. Furthermore, we use an **environment file** to specify to a user which packages need to be install to run our code.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will get to `make` in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: Technically speaking, as implemeted in this workflow, a `conda` environment is **not reproducible**. Even if you specify a specific version of a package in your `environment.yml`, the way its dependencies get resolved may differ in their versions. One way to fix this is to have an additional file called a **lockfile** that ensure that the environment is completely reproducible (eg. `pipenv` does this). This is the **right way** to handle such things, and we are hoping conda catches up quickly. In the meantime, we've simulated this behavior using an `environment.yml` and an `environment.lock` file generated from it.\n"
